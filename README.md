# Tsuki

## Overview

Tsuki is a gtk4-layer-shell widget system that allows you to create and style your desktop with lua + css. 

> Tsuki is under heavy development, and isn't currently ready for daily use. It's my first big c project, so the structure may heavily change between now and version 1.0.
> Feedback would be greatly appriciated. You can contact me here: https://discord.gg/UwAwbXPGax

## Running

I've yet to make it installable, but you can run `./debug.sh` for a debug build
